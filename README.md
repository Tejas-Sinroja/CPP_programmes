# Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an extension of the C programming language and is widely used for system/software development, game development, real-time simulations, and performance-critical applications.

## ðŸ”§ Features of C++

- **Compiled Language**: Translates code into machine code for fast execution.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Includes reusable templates for data structures and algorithms.
- **Low-Level Memory Manipulation**: Offers direct access to memory using pointers.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be compiled and run on different operating systems.
- **Extensive Community & Library Support**

## ðŸ§± Basic Structure of a C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
